# OSNA-Project-Twitter

As part of this project we explored twitter api’s and did analysis on following twitter data using Python & Gephi.

1. Donald Trump twitter’s account data analysis using Python
2. Personal account twitter account data analysis using Python
3. Twitter Data Analysis of Donald Trump & Elon Musk using Gephi


For point 1 & 2 we followed a systematic approach as mentioned in the project requirement document starting with extracting twitter data using twitter API thereby creating Consumer & Access Token and using the same to extract data of Donald Trump and personal account.

We did exploratory data analysis on the extracted data by identifying features like number of timeline tweets, number of followers or home timeline tweets etc.

For personal account twitter data analysis we utilized twitter api to extract data and gephi to visualize the graphs for followers following the network


For point 3 we used inbuilt functionality of Gephi to extract Twitter data for Donald Trump & Elon Musk and ran various algorithms provided within the Gephi console to calculate metrics like Modularity, Degree Distribution (both in degree & out degrees), pagerank, Centrality Distribution & Eccentricity Distribution for both of these accounts.


Having said that, we can say that we were successful in understanding how twitter API works and what is the process behind extracting twitter data using it. 

We also understood how to use python libraries such as tweepy to do data analysis on the extracted data and use python libraries to do visualizations to an extent.

The major learning from this project is to understand altogether a new visualization tool i.e. Gephi. It is a great and easy to use tool with lots of exciting features. Its ability to apply lots of exploratory algorithms with just a click makes it very easy to use and allows end users to get rid of lots of complexities thereby saving huge amounts of time.
